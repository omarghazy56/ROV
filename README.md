## Project Overview
### Description
The ROV Project is an advanced underwater vehicle designed for marine exploration and environmental monitoring. It is equipped with state-of-the-art computer vision (CV) capabilities to detect, track, and analyze underwater objects in real-time.

### Motivation
The motivation behind this project is to create a versatile and robust tool for marine biologists, environmental researchers, and underwater enthusiasts to explore and monitor underwater ecosystems efficiently, and to join competitions like Mate ROV.

### Goals
- Develop a reliable underwater navigation system.
- Implement real-time object detection and tracking.
- Ensure robust data collection and environmental monitoring.
- Create an easy-to-use interface for controlling the ROV.

## Features
- **Underwater navigation:** Navigate autonomously or manually using a controller.
- **Real-time video streaming:** Stream high-definition video from the ROVâ€™s camera.
- **Object detection and tracking:** Utilize computer vision to detect and follow objects underwater.
- **Autonomous operation:** Pre-programmed missions for autonomous exploration.
- **Data logging:** Record environmental data such as temperature, depth, and water quality.
